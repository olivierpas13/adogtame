# Adogtame

Adogtame is a project dedicated to connecting dogs in need of homes with potential adopters. The platform primarily focuses on assisting rescuers, individuals who can no longer care for their dogs, and those who have found stray dogs and want to place them for adoption. Our mission is to offer an intuitive and user-friendly platform where users can search for dogs based on specific criteria and easily connect with shelters, rescuers, or individuals to streamline the adoption process.
